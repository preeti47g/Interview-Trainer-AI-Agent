## Overview

The **Interview Trainer AI Agent** is a Jupyter Notebook-based solution designed to:

- Simulate realistic interview questions and dialogues using generative AI.
- Analyze user responses and provide structured, actionable feedback.
- Enable iterative practice and improvement—ideal for students, job seekers, or anyone looking to sharpen their interview skills.

The project is tailored and tested for the IBM Cloud watsonx.ai Studio platform, making use of its AI services, APIs, and managed notebook environment.

## Getting Started in IBM watsonx.ai Studio

1. **Clone this repository** into your IBM watsonx.ai Studio project.
2. **Open `Interview-Agent code.ipynb`** in the watsonx.ai JupyterLab interface.
3. **Follow the notebook cells**:
    - Install/verify dependencies (Python, Watson libraries, etc.)
    - Set up credentials and API access (see screenshots for setup details)
    - Run the interview simulation and feedback cells
4. **(Optional) Deploy** using `Interview-Agent-Deployment code.ipynb` to expose as a web app or API.

*Note: Screenshots and the [API reference](api%20reference.png) illustrate required configurations and workflow.*

## How It Works

- The notebook uses IBM Watsonx.ai's foundation models (LLMs) to generate tailored interview questions.
- User responses are analyzed by the AI for content, clarity, and relevance.
- Feedback is output as text and/or visual analytics within the notebook.
- The deployment notebook shows how to serve the agent as an interactive web/API app using IBM Cloud's managed infrastructure.

---

## Customization

- **Question Sets:** You can modify the prompts in the notebook to focus on specific industries or job roles.
- **Feedback Style:** Tune the feedback logic to emphasize different skills (communication, technical depth, etc.)
- **Integration:** The deployment notebook can be adapted to connect with external apps, Slack, or web frontends.
